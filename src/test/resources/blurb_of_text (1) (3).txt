Iraq crisis: Mosul air strike 'kills 50'. Islamic State (IS) fighter in Mosul (22 June 2014). Iraqi government forces have been unable to dislodge Islamic State fighters from Iraq's second city. Continue reading the main story. Struggle for Iraq. 'Jihadistan'. Shia take on Isis. Key Sunni players. Shrines destroyed. At least 50 people have been killed in an air strike on a building under Sunni militant control in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, officials say. Medical sources say it hit a prison run by the Islamic State (IS), a jihadist group that seized the city in June. However, the military spokesman for the prime minister said an Islamic court formed by the jihadists was the target. Elsewhere, a series of car bombs struck crowded markets in Shia districts of Baghdad, killing at least 47 people. Kurdish forces, known as Peshmerga, were also reportedly shelling eastern districts of Mosul and an area to the north-east on Wednesday. Iraqi state TV reported that the Mosul air strike had freed about 300 people held by the IS at the prison, which the group had reportedly been using as a religious court and detention centre. Sources told the BBC that some of the detainees held by the group were among the dead, adding that a drone might have been used in the attack. Thousands trapped. Earlier, a senior Kurdish official warned that 50,000 members of the Yazidi religious minority trapped in mountains to the west faced death if they were not rescued soon. The Yazidis fled there with few supplies after fighters from IS - previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) - overran the town of Sinjar at the weekend. Yazidi families, on the outskirts of Sinjar, flee fighting between Peshmerga and Islamic State fighters (5 August 2014). Thousands of Yazidis fled into the mountains near Sinjar after the Islamic State (IS) overran the town. Grey line. Khalil, one of the thousands of Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar, told the BBC that their appeals for help were being ignored. "We're hiding inside caves. We have nothing - no food and no water. We've been under siege for four days. We eat once a day - either in the morning or at night. We've managed to get some basic food supplies from neighbouring areas, but three children died today because of starvation. Seven women and children have died since yesterday because of dehydration. A lot of the people here have disabilities or suffer from serious illnesses. It's 50C (120F) here and we're being bombarded indiscriminately. We need help. Until now, no humanitarian aid has been delivered and no help provided by aid organisations - not the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, or even the United Nations. The Iraqi government and the Iraqi president have not helped. Nothing at all. Grey line. "Urgent international action is needed to save them. Many of them - mainly the elderly, children and pregnant women - have died," Jabbar Yawar, secretary-general of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ministry in charge of the Peshmerga, told the Reuters news agency. On Tuesday, the UN said it had received credible reports that 40 Yazidi children had died "as a direct consequence of violence, displacement and dehydration" since Sunday. Government officials said 77 tonnes of food and water had been air-dropped in the area since Tuesday. Smoke rises from the scene of a battle between Kurdish and Islamic State fighters on the outskirts of Sinjar (5 August 2014). Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have launched a counter-offensive, Kurdish officials say. Sinjar fell during an offensive that saw the IS and its allies seize several other towns in the north-west, an oil field and Iraq's biggest dam, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the Peshmerga. A senior official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said fighters from the Syria-based Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) had launched a counter-offensive. Map. "The fighters of [the PYD] and the PKK are responsible for confronting [the Islamic State] in Rabia and the Sinjar area," Hallo Penjweny told the AFP news agency. "On our side, we are taking care of Zumar and the rest of the area north and east of Mosul.". . Mr Yawar said Peshmerga fighters were also attacking IS positions in Makhmur, south-west of the Kurdistan Region's capital of Irbil, and that military co-operation with Baghdad had been re-established. Ties were strained by the KRG's decision to send Peshmerga forces into disputed areas of northern Iraq in June after soldiers abandoned their posts in the face of the IS advance; a push by Kurdish leaders for an independence referendum; and Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's claim in July that they were giving sanctuary to extremists. Kurds have also joined Sunni Arabs and some Shia in calling on Mr Maliki to step down because of his handling of the crisis, as well as what they say are the sectarian and authoritarian policies he has pursued. But as the leader of the bloc that won the most seats in April's parliamentary elections, Mr Maliki has demanded the right to attempt to form a governing coalition. In a televised address on Wednesday, he said any unconstitutional attempt to form a new government would "open the gates of hell". Ebola Toll Tops 900; Saudis Investigate Death. by VOA News. The deadly Ebola outbreak on Wednesday showed new signs of spreading, as Nigeria confirmed a second death plus five new cases and Saudi Arabia reported it was investigating the suspicious death of a man who traveled through West Africa. The new cases in Nigeria raise concerns that the virus will spread further in the region's most populous nation, with its 174 million residents. So far, the smaller and less populous countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been the epicenter of the outbreak, which has claimed 932 deaths among more than 1,700 cases, the World Health Organization reported Wednesday. ??. WHO was holding an emergency meeting Wednesday, deciding whether the Ebola outbreak – the worst since the disease was discovered late in the 20th century – should be designated an international public health emergency. There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, although the disease is not always fatal. A person stricken with Ebola experiences fever, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal pain that in the worst cases end with uncontrollable hemorrhaging – bleeding from body openings including the ears, eyes and mouth – and death. Nigerian officials said a nurse who treated the country's first Ebola patient two weeks ago died Tuesday of the disease. She was the first known Nigerian to have died from Ebola. The other victim was Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American who flew into Nigeria from Liberia with the disease. He was hospitalized in Lagos and died July 25. ??The five other Nigerian patients are now in isolation at a Lagos hospital. All are health workers who treated Sawyer. Nigeria is bracing for the possibility of more infections. Health Minister  Onyebuchi Chukwu said the government is establishing a 24-hour-a-day Ebola command center and is trying to prepare hospitals around the country in case the disease spreads further. “We need to work with each state government to establish isolation wards in readiness for any eventuality,” Chukwu said, noting the one in Lagos State would be strengthened and expanded. Ebola suspected in Saudi death. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's official news agency reported that a suspected Ebola patient died in Jeddah on Wednesday despite two days of intensive hospital treatment. The man came down with symptoms of Ebola after a business trip to Sierra Leone. . Saudi health officials have sent tissue samples to laboratories abroad to confirm whether the deceased patient had been infected by Ebola. Liberia prays for relief.  . In Liberia, where WHO has reported at least 282 deaths from the virus, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s message to the nation Tuesday night boiled down to this: God help us. “Relying on his divine guidance for our survival as a nation,” she said, “I call on all Liberians to observe three days of national fast and prayer to see God’s face, to have mercy on us and forgive our sins and heal our land.”. Beginning Wednesday, Liberians are to fast and pray from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sirleaf’s pronouncement has gotten mixed reactions in the capital, Monrovia. Some say it shows just how desperate the situation has become while others tell VOA it is an important step to keep people calm and unified. Some had already heeded the president's call as of daylight Wednesday. About 700 people, some dressed in white, gathered here at the Abundant Life Church Church on the outskirts of Monrovia. “…The nation will survive.  Hallelujah.  Our country will emerge victorious over this incurable disease,” Pastor Varney Yarwo preached from the pulpit. ‘The Dark Week’. The Liberian health ministry said 94 people died of Ebola over seven days beginning July 27, in what its latest report calls "The Dark Week.". Daily life has ground to halt in much of Liberia. Police are protecting health workers and facilities as fear and frustration continue to breed hostility. The president has put nonessential government workers on mandatory leave, closed schools and told citizens to avoid large public gatherings. That's all in the hope of reducing transmission of the disease, spread through bodily fluids, while health workers scramble to contain existing cases. In neighboring Sierra Leone, considered the most dangerous zone of this regional outbreak, soldiers have deployed to the east to quarantine the most affected areas. The government’s actions come amid reports that people there are not cooperating with efforts to isolate the sick and those who may have been exposed to the disease. This week, the World Bank pledged up to $200 million in emergency funding to help Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone contain the outbreak, improve public health systems and help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis. American patients improving. Two American missionaries who contracted Ebola in Liberia are said to be improving after receiving an experimental treatment. Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly are in a hospital isolation unit in the U.S. city of Atlanta. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is still too early to know whether the experimental drug, Zmapp, can save their lives.  . The manufacturer of the drug, California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said in a statement that very little of the drug is available but that the company is working with government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.
